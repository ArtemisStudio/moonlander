# Moonlander

Moonlander is a liquid staking solution for GLMR stakers in Moonbeam Network. Moonlander lets users stake their GLMR and periodically compounding to maximize user's yields.

## V2
Updates
* Introduce epoch mechanism. Epoch is based on the "Rounds" in Moonbeam. All the withdraw requests during each epoch will be executed at the same time to avoid conflict due to the exit delay feature in Moonbeam staking.
* Add staked Moonlander GLMR (sGLMR) token which will act as interest bearing token to reflect the compounding rewards for all Moonlander GLMR (mGLMR) stakers.
